// Josephus problem

// You are playing a game with n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n.
// Starting from person 1, every kth person is eliminated in a circular fashion. The process continues until only one person remains.
// Given integers n and k, return the position (1-based index) of the person who will survive.
